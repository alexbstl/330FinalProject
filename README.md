	To complete this assignment, we studied an online tutorial (https://thinkster.io/tutorials/mean-stack#wiring-everything-up) to structure our site. 
	The tutorial described construction of a simple blog using MEAN stack technology. We adapted this technology to create a course review website. 
	Much of the stucture used on this site was preserved in our final product. However, we used our improved understand of MEAN stack technology to 
	modify code to service our unique needs. It appears that the tutorial may have been updated tonight (the night of submission). As such, it's possible
	that some features may have changed. 
	
	In addition, we used (http://mherman.org/blog/2015/01/31/local-authentication-with-passport-and-express-4/) and (https://www.sitepoint.com/user-authentication-mean-stack/)
	to set up login and registration via Passport.js.
